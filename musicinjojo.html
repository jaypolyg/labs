                Music is a big foundation for the series and perhaps the most prominent and consistent form of
                media reference.
                Araki's use of music, primarily Western rock and pop music from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s is a
                fundamental aspect of the
                series' unique identity, enriching the narrative, character development, visual style and
                leaving long lasting, iconic names for the readers.

                Many characters and Stands are directly named after musical artists, albums, and songs leaving a
                greater impact than the more minor characters.
                <br>This started from Phantom Blood, with the main antagonist Dio being named after Ronnie James Dio
                and his band DIO, Speedwagon was named after the rock band REO Speedwagon
                and the Zeppeli surname seems to be a tribute to the band Led Zeppelin
                Dire and Straizo who were also some of Jonathan Joestar's first allies are a direct reference to the
                English rock band Dire Straits.
                The theme continued throughout Battle Tendency, with the main antagonists the Pillar Men all named
                after iconic music
                figures. Staring with the hard rock band AC/DC, the pop duo Wham!, the American guitarist Santana,
                and the American rock band The Cars.
                <h4 class="gap">The introduction of stands.</h4>
                With the introduction of stands in Stardust Crusaders, music started influencing artistic design and
                attack names
                with some of the casts stands being designed off albums and their abilities being references to
                lyrics.
                Like iggy who's name comes from pop singer Iggy Pop and his stand The Fool which is based off Iggy
                Pop's album The Idiot.
                <br>
                Similarly Muhammad Avdol, named after American singer Paula Abdul has an attack called Crossfire
                Hurricane, derived from the Rolling Stones song Jumpin'Jack Flash.
                It is also speculated among fans that his stand is based off the song The Magician's Birthday by
                Uriah Heep.
                <br>
                A more unique approach to the musical references was seen in Stone Ocean where Green Baby's stand
                Green Grass of Home is replicated the pose from
                the Nirvana album cover of Nevermind.
                <br>
                Albums, songs and artists for character names continues all the way to the current last part with
                some of the most popular ones being: DIO, Stone Free, KISS, Foo Fighters,
                Bohemian Rhapsody, C-moon, Sex Pistols, Sticky Finger, Aerosmith and more.
                <h4 class="gap">The alternate universe.</h4>
                The Steel Ball Run universe continued the name and stand name thematic with a unique addition of
                naming horses after songs and bands.
                <br>
                Johnny's horse is named after the song and album Slow Dancer by Boz Scaggs, Diego's is named after
                the band Silver
                Bullet and Pocoloco's stand and horse are both named Hey Ya! which is a popular pop song by outkast.
                <br>
                Having more than just the stands named after musical themes shows just how much Araki is inspired by
                music.
